### Replaces:

* Blue - Extruder Motor Mount
* Blue - Extruder Support

   I changed these components because more clearance was needed for the FS-Leaver

* Blue - Z Motor Mount
* Blue - X Motor Carriage Front
* Blue - X Motor Carriage Back
* Black - Z End Cap

   I swapped these components to change the z rods from 8mm to 10mm and LM10LUU linear bearings
   this mitigates the z wobble, as user andySZ mentioned in his comment
   Black - Z Probe Suporte

   I changed this one to make it easier for the cable to pass through the hole and to make it easier to print
   For those who kindly helped me with the purchase of the complete model, just send me an email and I'll send you the new version with all the changes mentioned in the LOG

### Added:

* Black - FS Adapter
* Black - FS Leaver

   These components were missing for the filament sensor...

### Replaces:

* Black - MKS Adaptor Housing

   The cables for the main board didn't fit, I had to change it to wider...

### Future updates:

* Changing the Z axis rods to 10mm, user andySZ kindly mentioned checking some artifacts in the prints...
* Changing Z-Probe Suporte for extra clearance for the cable, mentioned also by andySZ
* Changing Y-Rods length because of collision with the belt tensioner, to allow full use of the bed, once again mentioned by andySY

   Thanks Andy For All the help...
